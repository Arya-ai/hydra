# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the [Issue](https://github.com/Arya-ai/hydra/issues) page, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Suggesting a feature

We can't think of everything. If you've got a good idea for a feature, then please let us know!

Feature suggestions are embraced, but will often be filed for a rainy day. If you require a feature urgently, it's best to write it yourself. Don't forget to share ;)

When suggesting a feature, make sure to:

* Check the code on Github to make sure it's not already hiding in an unreleased version.
* Considered if it's necessary in the library, or is an advanced technique that could be separately explained in an example
* Check existing issues, open and closed, to make sure it hasn't already been suggested.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

#### Do

* Do use [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
* Do comment your code where necessary
* Do submit only a single example/feature per pull-request
* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do
* Do add details of your example to examples/README.md if it exists

#### Don't

* Don't include any license information in your example - our repositories are MIT licensed
* Don't try to do too much at once - submit one or two examples at a time, and be receptive to feedback
* Don't submit multiple variations of the same example, demonstrate one thing concisely
